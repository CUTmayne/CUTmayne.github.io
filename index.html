		<h1>Andrew's Coding Corner</h1>
		<img src="webphoto1.jpg">
		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Andrew and I write computer programs. Originally training to be a professional
		musician, I have a strong background in the arts. I find mathematics to be highly stimulating
		and my choice to learn programming is motivated by that affection.</p>
		<h2>Objective</h2>
		<p>My long-term goal is to work with aerospace industries in pursuit of space-faring technologies.
		I want to make commercial space flight practical and safe within my lifetime. Secondarily, I wish to 
		influence the teaching of math and science in public schools to stay ahead of competing countries.</p>
		<h2>My Experience</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Java Programming</li>
		</ul>
			<p>I've worked extensively with basic algorithms and some fluency with the java graphics API.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Rudamentary HTML/CSS (this is why my page looks like something out of 2002)</li>
			<li>Unity Development</li>
			<li>Music production in FLstudio</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Work History</h2>
		<p>I have volunteered as a desktop support technician for a local south Georgia business and I 
		have extensive customer service experience.</p>
		<h2>Other Activities</h2>
		<p>Previously, I have taught music in one of Clyattville Elementary School's after-school clubs.</p>
